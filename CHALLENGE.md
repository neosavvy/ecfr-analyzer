Project: eCFR Analyzer

The goal of this project is to create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations. The eCFR is available at https://www.ecfr.gov/. There is a public api for it.
Please write code to download the current eCFR and analyze it for items such as word count per agency and historical changes over time. Feel free to add your own custom metrics.
There should be a front end visualization for the content where we can click around and ideally query items. Additionally, there should be a public github project with the code.
When you finish the project please submit an email to recruiting@doge.eop.gov with the following:

- Feedback on the project
- Duration 
- Link to github repo
- Link to frontend 

While there is no deadline, we advise you to spend no more than 24 total hours on this assignment.

Thank you and we look forward to reviewing your submission.
